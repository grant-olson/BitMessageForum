# BMF

BitMessageForum allows you to browse and post bitmessages in a
forum-like view in the web browser of your choice.

Although BMF is configured to run in your browser, it is designed to
be a local application.  it assumes that if you can talk to your
bitmessage server, you are fully authorized to read/send/delete any
messages, create new identities, etc.

It is **not** designed to be setup as a publically facing website.
Although it would be possible to use the software to mirror a channel
via a web interface, this would break the self-destruct feature that
removes bitmessages from the network after a few days. So please don't
do that!

## Installation

### Prerequisites

#### Software

The following software is required:

* [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* Ruby development toolchain.  `apt-get install ruby-dev` on Debian-based platforms.
* [PyBitmessage](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page)

#### PyBitmessage API configuration

To enable the API for PyBitmessage you must add the following to
the `[bitmessagesettings]` section of keys.dat:

    apienabled = true
    apiport = 8442
    apiinterface = 127.0.0.1
    apiusername = bmf
    apipassword = bmf

### Initial installation

    gem install bmf

### Running the software

    bmf

If you are using different settings for the PyBitmessage server, you
will need to change that on the [settings
page](http://localhost:4567/settings/) or by manually editing
`config/settings.yml`.

### Developers. Run from the source:

    sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
    sudo gem install bundler
    git clone https://github.com/grant-olson/BitMessageForum.git
    cd BitMessageForum
    sudo bundle install
    ./bmf-dev

### Running PyBitmessage as a daemon

If you find yourself using BMF all the time and don't want to see the
PyBitmessage UI, you can start PyBitmessage as a daemon.

First, add the following to the `[bitmessagesettings]` section of `keys.dat`:

    daemon = true

Next, start PyBitmessage like so:

    nohup python src/bitmessagemain.py &

This will start up PyBitmessage in the background without the QT GUI.
